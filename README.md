# Intelligent Culpability Detection System Using Computer Vision
This project aims to automate the process of determining who is responsible for a car accident in order to reduce traffic congestion. Using computer vision, we analyze the pictures ðŸŽ‘ and determine if there is any damage and how deep it is. In addition, the vehicle's position is determined. Furthermore, using a fault recognition decision-making system, we determine which vehicle is responsible for the accidentðŸš˜, as well as the mistake percentage of each vehicle.

## Data Preparation

- The damage detection model is trained on [Roboflow car damage](https://example.com/paper.pdf](https://app.roboflow.com/khadijah-baouthman-tvhkx/culpability-detection-system/2)https://app.roboflow.com/khadijah-baouthman-tvhkx/culpability-detection-system/2) dataset. Then, it anotated manually.
  
- The damage depth predection model trained on [Fast, Furious and Insured](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/infernape/fast-furious-and-insured) dataset.

## Model Training
The first model is a pre-trained model called You Only Look Once (YOLO). We focused on a [YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) for damage detection. For the second model, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is created from scratch to determine the depth of the damage as shown below. ![](Images/CNN.png).
