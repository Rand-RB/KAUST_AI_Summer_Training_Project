# Intelligent Culpability Detection
System Using Computer Vision
his approach aims to automate the process of recognizing carðŸš˜
accident faults to reduce traffic congestion. By using computer vision, we can analyze the
pictures of the accidentðŸŽ‘ and, using a fault recognition decision-making systemðŸ§ , we determine
which of the vehicles is responsible for the accident as well as the mistake percentage of
each vehicle.

## Data Preparation

- The damage detection model is trained on [Roboflow car damage]([#https://example.com/paper.pdf](https://app.roboflow.com/khadijah-baouthman-tvhkx/culpability-detection-system/2)https://app.roboflow.com/khadijah-baouthman-tvhkx/culpability-detection-system/2) dataset. Then, it anotated manually.
  
- The damage depth predection model trained on [Ehab Dataset]([#https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/infernape/fast-furious-and-insured]) dataset.


## Model Training
The first model is a pre-trained model called You Only Look Once (YOLO). We focused on a [YOLOv8]([#https://github.com/username/charting-library](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)) for damage detection. For the second model, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is created from scratch to determine the depth of the damage as shown below.
